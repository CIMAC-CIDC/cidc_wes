# metasheet.csv- This sheet groups your samples into matched pairs, i.e. "runs"
# each run requires a RunName and at least one Normal (Cont) and an 
# optional Tumor sample (Treat).  Use the sample names defined in config.yaml
# for Normal and Tumor columns (they must match the SampleName defined in
# config.yaml)
#
# You can define up to 1 replicate-using Treat2 and Cont2. 
# ALL CONTROLS ARE optional (but missing treatments will throw an error!)
