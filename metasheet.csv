# metasheet.csv- This sheet groups your samples into matched pairs, i.e. "runs"
# each run requires a RunName and a Normal and a Tumor sample.
# ***IMPORTANT: for Normal and Tumor columns, use the SampleName defined in
# config.yaml.
#
# The final column, Cohort, allows you to group runs into cohorts
# Cohort names can be any alphanumeric string and "_"
# Give runs (i.e. rows) that belong in the same cohort group the same cohort
# name OR leave it blank if the run is NOT part of a cohort
#
# **A minimal of 2 runs are required for each cohort set
# As of now, runs can only belong to one cohort
#
# For Tumor-only runs, leave the normal sample empty, e.g.
# Run1,,Tumor_sample1, group1
