# metasheet.csv- This sheet groups your samples into matched pairs, i.e. "runs"
# each run requires a RunName and a Normal and a Tumor sample.
# ***IMPORTANT: for Normal and Tumor columns, use the SampleName defined in
# config.yaml.
#
# For Tumor-only runs, leave the normal sample empty, e.g.
# Run1,,Tumor_sample1
RunName,Normal,Tumor
Run1,Normal_sample1,Tumor_sample1
