#REF.yaml - File to contain paths to static reference files that Chips requires
#           for its analysis.
# NOTE: these are already pre-filled for hg19 and mm9 (if you use the publicly
#       available files found here: <link to chips static references)
# NOTE: organized by assemblies
# 
# !VERY IMPORTANT: you can OVERRIDE any of these values in config.yaml!
